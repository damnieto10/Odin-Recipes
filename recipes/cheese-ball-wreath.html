        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        
        <ul>
            
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese</li>
            <li>8 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, shredded</li>
            <li>½ (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning</li>
            <li>1 bunch fresh cilantro, stems removed</li>
            <li>4 stalks green onions, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>1 (4 ounce) can diced green chile peppers</li>
            <li>1 medium Roma tomato, cored and diced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped white onion</li>
            <li>1 medium jalapeno pepper, seeded and finely chopped</li>

        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        
        <ol>

            <li>Line a 16-ounce bowl with plastic wrap, allowing excess to hang over the sides.</li>
            <li>Combine cream cheese, Monterey Jack cheese, and taco seasoning in a food processor; process until well combined. Add green onions, ½ of the cilantro leaves, and green chiles and pulse until well combined with flecks of green; do not fully process.</li>
            <li>Transfer cheese mixture to the lined bowl and press to smooth. Cover and refrigerator for at least 4 hours or up to 8 hours or overnight.</li>
            <li>Invert cheese onto a serving platter and remove plastic. Use a small shot glass or spoon to create a hole in the center of the cheese to form a wreath shape.</li>
            <li>Finely chop remaining cilantro leaves and lightly cover the top of the cheese. Combine tomato, onion, and jalapeno in a small bowl and place over the cilantro in a 1-inch ring around the wreath.</li>

        </ol>
